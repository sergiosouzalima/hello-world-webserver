================

* Main goal: Hello World Web Server in Ruby! (an example of minimal Dockerization)

Instruction to run
--------------

* On your local computer
  - docker container run --name webserver --rm -p 3000:3000 sergiosouzalima/hello-world-webserver

Browser
--------------
localhost:3000

Output
--------------
Hello World!


Ruby
-------------

This application was built in:

- Ruby 2.5.0

Why Ruby?
---------
* For this solution I chose Ruby due to its clear, elegant & very effective syntax.
  Ruby is one of the most wanted modern languages to learn nowadays.
  In this case, of course I could have chosen other languages like Python or .Net,
  but Ruby is the language i like the most for the time being :-D .
